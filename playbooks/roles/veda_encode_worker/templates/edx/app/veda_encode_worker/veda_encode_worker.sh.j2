# source xyz.sh runs that file
# If you check worker.sh it expects two arguments, one of them is mandatory
# the two arguments represent - $1 - a celery queue name and 
# $2 - something related to worker.$2.%h 
# If you check instance_config.yaml in edx-video-worker repository,
# you will find many celery queues
# Only one of those queues is defined and that is celery_deliver_queue
